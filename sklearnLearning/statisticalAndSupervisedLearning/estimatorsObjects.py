#the main API implemented by scikit-learn is that of the estimator. An estimator is any object that learns from data; it may be a classification, regression or clustering algorithm or a transformer that extracts/filters useful features from raw data.
#All supervised estimators in scikit-learn implement a fit(X, y) method to fit the model and a predict(X) method that, given unlabeled observations X, returns the predicted labels y.

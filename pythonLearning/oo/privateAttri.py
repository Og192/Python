# In a class named Dog, if you name an instance attribute in the form __mood (two leading underscores and zero or at most one trailing underscore), 
# Python stores the name in the instance __dict__ prefixed with a leading underscore and the class name,
# so in the Dog class, __mood becomes _Dog__mood, 
# and in Beagle itâ€™s _Beagle__mood. This language feature goes by the lovely name of name mangling.
